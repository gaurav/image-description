{"description": "This image captures a scene on a sandy beach within the Galapagos Islands. A large, brown sea lion is the central subject, resting on the sand with its head raised, seemingly observing the surroundings. In the background, several tourists are walking along the beach, some with cameras. The beach is bordered by dark volcanic rocks, and the turquoise ocean stretches out to the horizon. A cruise ship is visible in the far background.", "individuals": [{"description": "Sea Lion", "interactions": ["Observing the surroundings"]}, {"description": "Tourists", "interactions": ["Walking along the beach", "Taking photographs"]}, {"description": "Cruise Ship", "interactions": ["Visible in the background"]}], "entities": ["Galapagos Islands", "Sandy Beach", "Volcanic Rocks", "Ocean", "Cruise Ship"]}
