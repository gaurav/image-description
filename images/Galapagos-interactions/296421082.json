Bubbles are visible around its head and body, indicating the presence of scuba divers. Two dark-colored scuba divers are partially visible in the background, wearing black wetsuits and holding onto the sea lion for a photo opportunity. The water is a vibrant blue color.", "individuals": [{"description": "Galapagos Sea Lion", "interactions": ["Swimming", "Being photographed by scuba divers"]}, {"description": "Scuba Diver 1", "interactions": ["Holding the sea lion for a photograph"]}, {"description": "Scuba Diver 2", "interactions": ["Holding the sea lion for a photograph"]}], "entities": ["Galapagos Islands", "Sea Lion", "Scuba Divers", "Water (Blue)", "Bubbles"]}
